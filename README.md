## 🛠️ How It Works
1. **API Fetch**: Fetches live currency data from an external API in JSON format.
2. **Async/Await**: Uses `async/await` to handle API calls, ensuring real-time data fetching without blocking the UI.
3. **Conversion**: Users input an amount, select their desired currencies, and the application calculates the converted amount based on live exchange rates.
